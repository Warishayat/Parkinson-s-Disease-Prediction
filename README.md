## Data

The dataset utilized in this project contains features related to Parkinson's Disease. Proper preprocessing steps, including outlier removal, are essential for effective modeling.

## Installation

To set up the project environment, install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and preprocess the data.
2. **Outlier Removal**: Clean the dataset by removing outliers to improve model performance.
3. **Data Splitting**: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
4. **Data Standardization**: Standardize the feature values to ensure consistent scaling.
5. **Model Training**: Train the selected machine learning model.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the modelâ€™s performance using various metrics.

## Model Saving

After training, the model, the scaler, and the outlier removal function can be saved for future use.

## Results

- **Accuracy Score**: 0.96
- **Confusion Matrix**: [[5, 1], [0, 19]]
- **Classification Metrics**:
  - Precision: 0.95
  - Recall: 1.0
  - F1 Score: 0.974
